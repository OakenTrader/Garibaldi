    We are going to measure gdp indirectly by credit limit in the save file and the measurement of total
    cash reserve in a country.

    Each country has a gold reserve limit, which is a soft-cap equal to 20% of its annual 
    gross domestic product (GDP) (Vickypedia)

    A country's credit limit is the maximum amount of principal it can borrow before going into default. 
    This limit is based on its buildings' current cash reserves plus Â£100K plus 50% of its GDP. (Vickypedia)
