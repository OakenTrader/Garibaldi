class Extractor:
    """
    A class dedicated to parsing Victoria 3's common and saves from plain text to a JSON-parsable Python dictionary.

    Based on observed pattern, this class processes text data by removing comments, normalizing whitespace, and structuring data based on 
    nesting levels indicated by curly braces. It specifically handles conditions, logical checks, and assignments 
    within the game's data files, ensuring accurate representation in dictionary format which can be serialized into JSON.
    Extracted data is saved by first pickling the object and then zip it.
    
    Issues: 
    - Strings with whitespaces will be separated into different entries, "United States of America" will
    not be kept in a single variable.
    - DNA variables in the savefile contain equal signs which the script struggles to keep together.
    This should not affect other parts of the result.
    - Boolean scopes which perform logical operations like "One/all of the following must be true" not properly captured yet. 
    Implicit Boolean scope indicators (like possible = { A > 1 B ?= 2} and OR = {}) are not yet implemented

    Parameters:
    address (str): The file path of the text file to be parsed.
    is_save (bool, optional): Specify whether this is a save file or not which may reduce time by omitting operations required
                            in extracting definition files (like removing comments)
    focuses (str, optional): A specific section of the file to focus on, if any. If specified, parsing will 
                           only occur within the scope where this substring is found at the root level. Default is None.
    pline (bool, optional): If True, print each line of the file as it's processed. This is useful for debugging. 
                            Default is False.
    version (string, optional): Version of the game of this file.

    Attributes:
    data (dict): The structured data extracted from the file, organized as a nested dictionary.
    
    Methods:
    write(output, sections=None, separate=False): Write the data tree into a zipped pickle.

    Examples:
    extractor = Extractor("path/to/victoria3_data.txt", is_save=True, focus="population", pline=True)
    extractor.unquote()
    extractor.write("saves/campaign/save", ["population"])

        Effects:
        Modifies the dictionary 'scope' in-place, removing double quotes from all string values, including those
